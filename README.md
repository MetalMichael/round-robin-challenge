# Round Robin Challenge
A coding challenge for developer openings at The NUEL.

##Task##
Given a `Collection` of `Team` objects, print matchups for a round robin tournament. Each team should play every other team once. For simplicity's sake, you can assume that the number of teams is always even.

    Hench's Hydras (4) vs. Ian's Instigators (3)
